//! Integration between [`egui`] and SDL2’s [`sdl2::render::Canvas`] API.
//!
//! This module provides [`EguiCanvas`], a convenience wrapper that bundles
//! together:
//! - [`egui::Context`] for running your UI
//! - [`crate::State`] for event and input handling
//! - [`Painter`] for rendering using [`sdl2::render::Canvas`]
//!
//! # When to use
//! Use [`EguiCanvas`] if you want to render egui using SDL2’s 2D canvas API
//! instead of OpenGL.
//!
//! # Usage
//! The [`Canvas`] stays owned by you: build it however you like, then pass it to
//! the calls that need it. Typical usage is to:
//! 1. Create an [`EguiCanvas`] for your SDL2 canvas
//! 2. Pass SDL2 events to [`EguiCanvas::on_event`]
//! 3. Call [`EguiCanvas::run`] providing our UI function
//! 4. Paint egui output over whatever you drew via [`EguiCanvas::paint`]
//!
